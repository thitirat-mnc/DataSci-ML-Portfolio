# Data Science Portfolio 

A compilation of my projects in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
<br> Natural Language Processing, and Data Analysis.
   


<details><summary>Facial Expression Recognition System</summary>
<br>
    
**A system that automatically monitors people's emotions and expressions based on facial images**
  
- The dataset comprises 2000 images with facial key-point annotations and <br> 20,000 facial images, each labeled with facial expression categories.
  
- The tasks include detecting **facial key points** and <br> categorizing each face into one of five **emotion** categories.

**Tasks :**
- Perform image visualizations to understand the dataset.
- Perform **image augmentation** to increase dataset diversity.
- Conduct data **normalization** and prepare training data for model training.
- Build deep Convolutional Neural Networks **(CNNs)** and residual neural network **(RESNET)** models for facial key points detection.
- Save the trained model for **deployment**.

<details><summary>Restaurant Reviews Classification</summary>
<br>
    
**Aspect classification and sentiment analysis**
  
- The dataset contains 3156 rows. The text is drawn from restaurant reviews, tokenized using nltk.word_tokenize and <br> non-English alphabet symbols were cleaned out using regular expression
  
- The tasks include categorizing each text review into one of five **aspect catagories** and <br> into one of four **sentiment**.

**Tasks :**
- Bag-of-word **logistic regression** model as baseline for both sentiment and aspect classification, . <br> The features are created from the cleaned text 
- Perform **oversampling** by multiplying the number of conflict label data in the training set to increase dataset diversity.
- Trained both **multi-class** and multi-label logistic regression models for aspect classification.
- For **multi-label**, used a binary logistic regression model to train each aspect model separately, and combine the end result prediction.
- For Deep Learning Models, tried both pre-trained **GloVe** 300-dimensional word embeddings from stanford.edu and **Word2Vec**
- Build **Deep Averaging Network (DAN)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Tuned Hyperparameters using **grid search**

<details><summary> Next word Prediction</summary>
<br>

**Predicting next word based on the first letter**
  
- The training set is drawn from https://huggingface.co/datasets/gigaword
- The development set provided for evaluation contains 94,825 rows with 3 columns:
- 'context' column, 'first letter' column, and 'prediction' column.
- The 'first letter' column provides the initial letter of the word to be predicted for each context, while the 'prediction' column contains the actual word that is to be generated.
  
**Tasks :**
- For **trigram** model, a counter dictionary is used to count the number of occurrences of each trigram in the training data.
- The model is trained in small batches, with a batch size of 2048, to accommodate the large size of the training set.
- Once the model has been trained, the probability of each word is computed based on its frequency in the training data
- The trigram model is then used to predict the next word in a given context by selecting the word with the highest probability.
- For kenlm (pre-trained **5-gram model**), the next word in a given context is generated by looping over each word in the model's vocabulary and selecting the word with the highest probability.

<details><summary>Thai Name Enitity Recognition</summary>
<br>

**Name Entitiy Recognition (NER) for Thai Language**
  
- The training and development data for this project were in Thai, and were first tokenized and separated by '|' using the pythainlp library (newmm dictionary)
- The resulting text was then tagged with entity types, including 'ORG', 'PER', 'MEA', 'LOC', 'TTL', 'DTM', 'NUM', 'DES', 'MISC', 'TRM', and 'BRN', using 'B_' before each tag.
- Each word and tag were separated by '\t', while sentences were separated by '\n'.
- To preprocess the training data for the models, each word and tag in the dataset were split and stored in two separate lists:
- one for token sequences and one for label sequences.
  
**Tasks :**
- Implemented Conditional Random Fields **(CRF)** with only the word, the previous word, and the next word as features as baseline
- Added **conjunctive features** to the model, which took the form of {word i-1 – word i – word i+1}, resembling bigram and trigram features to capture more contextual information about the words
- Explored the use of conjunctive part- of-speech **(POS) tags** as a feature to recognize named entities based on grammatical context, using the pythainlp pos_tag (orchid_ud)
