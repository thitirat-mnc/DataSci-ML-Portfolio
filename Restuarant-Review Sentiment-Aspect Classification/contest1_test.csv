2109,"The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud)."
867,I loved it and would go again.

559,We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.

3590,"great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!"

3087,"While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique."
2847,"Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff."

1326,They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared.
2400,Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.
3171,THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
2998,"Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax."
1627,"Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly."

334,The food was great and the service was even better.
1558,"While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees."
913,Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
3003,The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).
3583,"Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them."

3428,We will be back.
3647,We were seated and ignored by waitstaff.
784,"If you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here."
1540,They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.
1980,"Tasty steak, pork loin, the works."
292,I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.
774,I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there.

732,"The burger was great, also."
1508,"they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible."

1610,The pizza was great.
3479,And everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.
1139,I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
1808,"however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
2933,"When we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless."
2226,The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
